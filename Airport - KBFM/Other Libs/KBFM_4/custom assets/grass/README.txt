This is my own custom vegetation. The undergrowth stuff is good and is used in PANC, however the grasses were not optimized and I decided to go with the misterX grass instead. If you are looking for grass.png I have removed it to save space since it isn't used. If you really want it for whatever reason you can find it in the "generic/grass" folder in this repository https://gitlab.com/StableSystem/asset-source
